"""
Discord introduced intents as a way to give bot developers more control over the data their bots receive from Discord servers. 
Intents are a mechanism to specify which events your bot is interested in and allowed to receive. 
This helps Discord manage and scale the amount of data sent to bots, especially in larger servers, 
and it provides more privacy and control over sensitive information.
By specifying the intents your bot needs, you reduce the amount of data sent over the WebSocket connection, making your bot more resource-efficient.
Intents help protect user privacy by restricting access to certain information, such as member lists and presence data, unless explicitly requested.
In large servers, restricting the data sent to bots based on their declared intents helps Discord manage the scalability of their systems.
