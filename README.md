# This is my journey to learn how to make Discord bots through a course on Udemy.
<br>

### The "bot2.py" and "example_bot.py" files are the bots I made with chat gpt to see how this works, and contribute very little to my learning.
<br>

### The "events.py" contains information about Discord events. Bot does "something" when an event occurs.
<br>

### The "commands.py" file has various commands that the discord bot obeys. For example, coin flip, rock paper scissors, etc.
<br>

### The "Cogs.py" file has cogs that are loaded as an extension in the "commands.py" file. Cogs contain specific functions that we can organize in a Python class which can be unloaded from our bot on command. We can even make changes to our Cogs file without halting the functionality of our bot, and if we have added new features to our bot, then we can just reload our bot with the new features without stopping it.
