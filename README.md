# This is my journey to learn how to make Discord bots through a course on Udemy.
<br>

### The "bot2.py" and "example_bot.py" files are the bots I made with chat gpt to see how this works, and contribute very little to my learning.
<br>

### The "events.py" contains information about Discord events. Bot does "something" when an event occurs.
<br>

### The "commands.py" file has various commands that the discord bot obeys. For example, coin flip, rock paper scissors, etc.
